ESZG517 — Internet of Things: Design and Development
Lab Session L1 — Sensor to Cloud
Student Skeleton File: l1_publisher.py

Name   : ___________________________
USN    : ___________________________
Date   : ___________________________

How this file works:
  1. The IoTLab Emulator runs and writes sensor data to a
     shared file on your computer (~/.iotlab/emulator_data.json)
  2. This script reads that file every 5 seconds
  3. It extracts 5 sensor fields and publishes them to HiveMQ
     Cloud as a JSON payload via MQTT over TLS

  Emulator must be running BEFORE you run this script.
  Enable a sensor panel in the emulator first.

Architecture:
  [IoTLab Emulator] --> emulator_data.json --> [This script] --> HiveMQ Cloud
